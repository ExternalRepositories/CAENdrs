I provide two different scripts as a reference, "setup.sh" and
"setup_expert.sh".

The CAENdrs plugin offers two different device types for the CAEN 1741.

setup.sh uses a no-frills setup "device_CAENdrs_std" where the unit is
set for a NIM pulse trigger, and generally useful parameters, but you
only get a limited parameter set. You can set the sampling speed (set
for 5GS here) and the delay by which the stop comes later (called
PostTriggerSize in CAEN parlance).

Note that the PostTriggerSize is given in % and the unit supports only
some discrete values, so your readback may be different.

Generally, larger PostTriggerSize values make your sign go "earlier"
in the samples waveform.


setup_expert.sh:

The other device ("device_CAENdrs") uses the 1741 in the way it finds
it without changing any settings. You must pre-configure all
parameters using the caen_client utility. This allows you to explore
the full parameter space, and set up highly customized
configurations. In setup_expert.sh I call setup_17741.sh to configure
the unit.

"caen_client" without parameters gives you a help text.

You can at any time view the configuration with caen_client status.
